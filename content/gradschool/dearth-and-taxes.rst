Although I am quite fortunate to receive a stipend to help me get
through graduate school, I wouldn’t exactly call my lifestyle luxurious.
I consider rice and beans to be an easy, cheap, nutritious meal, but for
some reason my non-grad student friends (let’s call them "real adults")
think that it is strange for me to want to eat this dish continuously.
Shouldn’t we all be restricting our meat intake, anyways?

A further financial complication arises from the fact that Uncle Sam
feels that we grad students are responsible enough to manage our
finances and pay our taxes without any help from him in the form of
withholdings. This makes sense, because the tax code is not difficult at
all to understand and we all have lots of free time to figure it out –
NOT. Unfortunately, my school does not seem to provide much in the way
of resources to help us decipher our fiduciary obligations.
 
In an effort to help future generations of grad students figure out
their tax situation, below is some of the meager knowledge I have gained
by searching through the intertubes and reading IRS pdfs. Note: I am not
a "professional" in any sense of the term, so the usual legal disclaimer
applies that you should not consider this to be tax advice; it is
general information only. Also note that my first year funding comes
from a NIH training grant. Different funding sources may result in
different tax scenarios.

* Grad students receiving scholarship money are not "self-employed" and
  do not need to pay the higher self-employment tax rate, even though
  there is at least \ `one
  example <http://scienceblogs.com/sciencewoman/2008/01/the_taxman_cometh_not_1.php>`__ of
  the IRS auditing a grad student and trying to get them to do so. This
  means that I am not currently contributing to social security or
  medicare and am just paying income taxes, which sucks because I think
  those programs are important.
* "Taxable income" for me is the difference between box 5 and box 1 on
  my 1098-T tuition statement form. This is higher than my stipend
  because it includes money which pays for my health insurance, which
  should also be taxed. 1098-T forms can be viewed online
  at \ `https://www.1098t.com <https://www.1098t.com/>`__
* Scholarship income is not "earned income" and thus I cannot make any
  IRA contributions using my stipend.  See this `forum
  thread <http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=58606&sid=f93454473a48ad06c451a04c24f49c11>`__
  and `IRS publication 590 <http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590.pdf>`__
  for details. The bottom-line from Pub 590: "Scholarship and
  fellowship payments are compensation for IRA purposes only if shown
  in box 1 of Form W-2"
* Since there is no witholding from my stipend, I must
  make \ `estimated
  tax <http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=110413,00.html>`__ payments
  quarterly, both to the IRS and to California's Franchise Tax Board.
