I created a simple python script to read in `Nate Silver's march
madness
predictions <http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/18/sports/ncaabasketball/nate-bracket.html>`__Â and
generate random brackets based on his given probabilities. This will
give a diverse, non-deterministic, set of potential brackets as results.
You can also run the simulation until you get a desired champion.

If you are interested in the script, it is available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/kylebarlow/marchmadness>`__.

Go bears...hopefully
