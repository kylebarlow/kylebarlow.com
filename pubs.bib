	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with impaired clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) from the brain, a process normally facilitated by apolipoprotein E (apoE). ApoE expression is transcriptionally induced through the action of the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma and liver X receptors in coordination with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Oral administration of the RXR agonist bexarotene to a mouse model of AD resulted in enhanced clearance of soluble Aβ within hours in an apoE-dependent manner. Aβ plaque area was reduced more than 50\% within just 72 hours. Furthermore, bexarotene stimulated the rapid reversal of cognitive, social, and olfactory deficits and improved neural circuit function. Thus, RXR activation stimulates physiological Aβ clearance mechanisms, resulting in the rapid reversal of a broad range of Aβ-induced deficits.},

	abstract = {Conformer generation has important implications in cheminformatics, particularly in computational drug discovery where the quality of conformer generation software may affect the outcome of a virtual screening exercise. We examine the performance of four freely available small molecule conformer generation tools (Balloon, Confab, Frog2, and RDKit) alongside a commercial tool (MOE). The aim of this study is 3-fold: (i) to identify which tools most accurately reproduce experimentally determined structures; (ii) to examine the diversity of the generated conformational set; and (iii) to benchmark the computational time expended. These aspects were tested using a set of 708 drug-like molecules assembled from the OMEGA validation set and the Astex Diverse Set. These molecules have varying physicochemical properties and at least one known X-ray crystal structure. We found that RDKit and Confab are statistically better than other methods at generating low rmsd conformers to the known structure. RDKit is particularly suited for less flexible molecules while Confab, with its systematic approach, is able to generate conformers which are geometrically closer to the experimentally determined structure for molecules with a large number of rotatable bonds (≥10). In our tests RDKit also resulted as the second fastest method after Frog2. In order to enhance the performance of RDKit, we developed a postprocessing algorithm to build a diverse and representative set of conformers which also contains a close conformer to the known structure. Our analysis indicates that, with postprocessing, RDKit is a valid free alternative to commercial, proprietary software.},

	abstract = {Author Summary   Designing new protein–ligand interactions has tremendous potential for engineering sensitive biosensors for diagnostics or new enzymes useful in biotechnology, but these applications are extremely challenging, both because of inaccuracies of the energy functions used in modeling and design, and because protein active and binding sites are highly sensitive to subtle changes in structure. Here we describe a new method that addresses the second problem and couples changes in the structure of the protein backbone and of the amino acid side chains, the amino acid sequence, and the conformation of the ligand and its orientation in the binding site. We show that our method improvements significantly increase the accuracy of designing protein–ligand interactions compared to current state-of-the-art design methods. We assess these improvements in two important tests: the first predicts mutations that change ligand-binding preferences in enzymes, and the second predicts protein sequences that bind a given ligand. In these tests, subtle conformational changes made in our model are essential to recapitulate both the results from engineering experiments and the sequence diversity occurring in natural protein families. These results therefore shed light on the mechanisms of how new protein functions might have emerged and can be engineered in the laboratory.},
