| I recently received a high-resolution image of a famous historical
figure (details to come soon...). Naturally, my roommates and I wanted
to print this famous person out and create a life-size cardboard cutout.
Since I only have the capability to print on standard 8.5 x 11 inch
paper, I needed a way to split the image onto multiple pages to print.
| I found web-based tools that can do this, or you could use Photoshop
or some other proprietary software, but I didn't find any good tools I
could use on Ubuntu to maintain resolution. I whipped up a Python script
that can do this, relying on the
`Pillow <http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ implementation of
PIL (Python Image Library). You can download it from
`Github <https://github.com/kylebarlow/image-splitter>`__. Feel free to
submit pull requests if you flesh it out further, as it is rather basic
right now (it's licensed under GPLv3).
